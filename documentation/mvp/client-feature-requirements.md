## **Introduction**

Hey team! ðŸš€

I had an exciting chat with the folks over at **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs**. They've been a staple in our community for over 30 years, and guess what? They've seen our LinkedIn post about offering app development services to small businesses. This is a golden opportunity for us!

## **Client Background**

The concept of HHP+W is all about the fusion of music and food. Think about it â€“ old school hip hop, delicious pizza, wings, and a chilled beverage. Their clientele mainly consists of urban professionals aged between 25-45. Plus, it's not just a restaurant; it's an art scene for artists who resonate with the hip hop culture.

Since the 2020 pandemic, they've adapted to the new normal by offering call-in orders. And with a recent Facebook ad, their phones haven't stopped ringing! But here's the catch â€“ they're still using a pencil and paper method to track orders. That's where we come in.

## **Objective**

They're looking for a POS (point of sale) application tailored for tablet devices. This will help streamline their order process and enhance customer experience. And the best part? We get to build it!

## **MVP Features**

Alright, let's break down what they're looking for:

- **User Authentication**: They want their staff to log in securely.
- **Menu Display**: A digital menu where customers can view items, prices, and descriptions.
- **Order Management**: A system to place, edit, and track orders.
- **Payment Integration**: They're keen on having multiple payment options, including credit cards and digital wallets.
- **Feedback System**: A platform where customers can leave reviews and ratings.

## **Next Steps**

I've jotted down the main points, but I'll be setting up a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into the specifics. I'll keep you all posted. Let's gear up and make this a success!

Remember, team, this is a fantastic opportunity for us. Let's put our best foot forward and deliver an exceptional product for **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs**!
